       <p class="mt-3"><b style="font-size: 20px;">Nelson Mandela </b>  was a South African <b>anti-apartheid</b> activist, politician, and statesman who
         served as the first president 
        of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative 
        democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. 
        Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress 
        (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.</p>
      
        <h5><b><u>History :-</u></b></h5>
         <p>Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. 
            Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. 
            Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election 
            in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution,
            Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past 
            human rights abuses.By the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both "the father of the nation"
             and "the founding father of democracy". </p>
